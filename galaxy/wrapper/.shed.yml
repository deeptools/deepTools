description: "deepTools: User-friendly tools for the normalization, quality control and visualization of deep-sequencing data"
long_description: |
  deepTools address the challenge of visualizing the large amounts of data that
  are now routinely generated from sequencing centers in a meaningful way. To do so,
  deepTools contain useful routines to process the mapped reads data through removal of
  duplicates and different filtering options to create coverage files in standard
  bedGraph and bigWig file formats. deepTools allow the creation of normalized
  coverage files or the comparison between two files (for example, treatment and control).

  Finally, using such normalized and standardized files, multiple visualizations can be
  created to identify enrichments with functional annotations of the genome.
  For a gallery of images that can be produced and a description of the tools see http://f1000.com/posters/browse/summary/1094053
